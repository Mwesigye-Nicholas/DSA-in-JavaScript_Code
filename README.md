## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in software development and competitive programming. Each implementation is designed to be efficient and easy to understand.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

- Basics of arrays and their operations (insert, delete, access).

### Linked Lists

- Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and associated operations.

### Stacks

- Implementation of stacks and methods for common operations (push, pop, peek).

### Queues

- Implementation of queues and operations (enqueue, dequeue).

### Trees

- Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and tree traversal algorithms.

### Graphs

- Adjacency list and matrix representations, along with traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

- Implementations of common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear search, binary search, and their complexities.

### Dynamic Programming

- Examples of dynamic programming solutions to classic problems.

## Usage

To use the algorithms and data structures in this repository, clone the repository and run the desired scripts using Node.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mwesigye-Nicholas/DSA-in-JavaScript_code.git
cd DSA-in-JavaScript_code
node FileName.js
```
